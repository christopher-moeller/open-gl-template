# OpenGLApp

## Description
OpenGLApp is a simple OpenGL application using GLFW for window and input management and GLEW for OpenGL extension handling. It should work as a template for graphics applications. This project is set up using `premake5` to automate the creation of Xcode project files for macOS.

## Features
- GLFW integration for cross-platform window creation.
- GLEW for OpenGL extension management.
- Fully configured with a `premake5.lua` script to generate build files for Xcode.

---

## Prerequisites

### Tools
1. **Premake5**: Ensure you have `premake5` installed. You can download it from the [Premake website](https://premake.github.io/).
2. **Xcode**: Install Xcode from the Mac App Store.
3. **GLFW and GLEW**: The project expects GLFW and GLEW to be included as subdirectories in the `vendor` folder.

### File Structure
Ensure the following file structure:
```
OpenGLApp/
├── premake5.lua
├── src/
│   ├── main.cpp
├── vendor/
│   ├── GLFW/
│   │   ├── include/
│   │   ├── lib/
│   │       └── libglfw3.a
│   ├── GLEW/
│   │   ├── include/
│   │   ├── lib/
│   │       └── libGLEW.a
```

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd OpenGLApp
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Place the precompiled GLFW and GLEW libraries in the `vendor` folder as per the structure above. Ensure that:
- The `include` directories contain the respective headers (`GLFW/glfw3.h`, `GL/glew.h`).
- The `lib` directories contain the precompiled static libraries (`libglfw3.a`, `libGLEW.a`).

### Step 3: Generate Xcode Project
Run `premake5` to generate the Xcode project files:
```bash
premake5 xcode4
```
This will create an Xcode project in the root folder.

### Step 4: Open Xcode and Build
1. Open the generated `.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.
2. Select the desired scheme (Debug or Release).
3. Click the "Run" button (or press `Cmd + R`) to build and run the application.

## premake5.lua
The `premake5.lua` script automates the setup of the Xcode project. It:
- Specifies project configurations (`Debug` and `Release`).
- Sets up include directories and library paths for GLFW and GLEW.
- Links the required libraries (`libglfw3.a`, `libGLEW.a`) and macOS frameworks (`OpenGL.framework`).

---

## main.cpp
The `main.cpp` file contains a simple OpenGL application that:
- Creates a GLFW window.
- Initializes GLEW.
- Renders a blank window and listens for input events.

## Known Issues
1. **Multiple Windows**: Ensure Xcode is not relaunching old processes. Disable "Debug: Attach to Process on Launch" in the Xcode scheme.
2. **Library Not Found**: Ensure `libglfw3.a` and `libGLEW.a` are correctly placed in the `vendor` directory.
3. **MetalTools Warning**: This warning can be safely ignored if the application functions correctly.
